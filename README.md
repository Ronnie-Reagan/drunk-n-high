## Drunk-n-High

Drunk-n-High is a minimal novelty shader for Minecraft (Iris-compatible) that intentionally disrupts visual clarity to make normal gameplay more difficult.

The shader operates entirely in screen space and does not modify game logic, entities, or world data.

### Features
- Optional horizontal screen mirroring
- Time-based wobble / distortion effect
- Hue rotation and color shifting using YIQ color space
- Lightweight and easy to toggle on/off

### Intended Use
- Short challenge runs (Hardcore or survival)
- Cursed or chaotic content creation
- Visual effect experimentation

### Warning
This shader applies visual distortion and color manipulation that may cause discomfort or disorientation. Use at your own discretion and discontinue use if discomfort occurs.

### Compatibility
- Minecraft: Java Edition
- Shader loaders: Iris
